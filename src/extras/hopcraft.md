# Hopcraft SMP: Modded Features

To keep things interesting, Hopcraft has plenty of QoL mods to add onto the base game in a way that isn't intrusive. :)

There are many changes, but here's a list with the most useful ones.

If you're on desktop, a scrollable table of contents will appear as a sidebar.

## Utilities

### Areas

To turn a region into an area, write the following on a sign, like so, followed by the name of your region.

```toml
[Area 10]
Hopville
```

Leaving the area name empty will generate a random name for your area.

![Area usage example](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/areas/c.jpg)

![Area demo](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/areas/d.gif)

### Better Spawner Control

Place 5 torches around any spawner to make it stop spawning mobs.

![0](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/better-spawner-control/a.png)

### Conduits Prevent Drowned

Prevents Drowned from spawning around a conduit, in a 400 block radius.

### Cycle Paintings

Right click a painting with another painting to cycle it!

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/cycle-paintings/a.gif)

### Dismount Entity

Sneak-right click a boat or minecart to free the entity within.

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/dismount-entity/a.gif)

### Easy Elevators

Connecting a 3x3 grid of iron or copper blocks with chains will create an elevator. Jump to teleport up a level, and sneak to go down a level.

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/easy-elevators/b.png)

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/easy-elevators/a.gif)

### Grass Seeds

Right-click a dirt block with a seed to turn it into a grass block!

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/grass-seeds/a.gif)

### Hoe Tweaks

The break speed for pumpkins and melons is now quick with a hoe, as well as an axe.

Till and un-till bigger areas with sneak-right-click.

| Hoe Type  | Till Range |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Wood      | 1x1        |
| Stone     | 3x3        |
| Gold      | 5x5        |
| Iron      | 5x5        |
| Diamond   | 7x7        |
| Netherite | 9x9        |

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/hoe-tweaks/c.gif)

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/hoe-tweaks/b.gif)

### Quick Right Click

Allows for beds, cartography tables, crafting tables, ender chests, grindstones, shulker boxes, smithing tables and stonecutters to be right-clicked from your hotbar, making them a bit more portable.

This also prevents the need to carry around a Silk Touch pickaxe for your ender chest.

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/quick-right-click/d.gif)

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/quick-right-click/b.gif)

### Recipe Commands

Allows you to check crafting recipes using the `/recipes` (or `/rec`) command.

Usage: `/rec [recipe]`, for example `/rec minecraft:repeater`

![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/340/553/2021-02-14_22.png)

### Replanting Crops

Breaking crops with a hoe will replant them automatically.

### Tree Harvester

Iron axes or better can now mine entire trees at once. Sneak-break the trunk of a tree to destroy it in one fell swoop!

It also works with nether trees.

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/tree-harvester/big_spruce.gif)

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/tree-harvester/nether_tree.gif)

### Universal Shops

A new block has been added for selling items to other people!

![](https://imgur.com/VH7voGh.png)

Check out the mod page for crafting and setup instructions: [Universal Shops - CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/universal-shops)

## Quality of Life

### CFr./Sc. Drops Nearby

Break down a tower of Chorus Fruit or Scaffolding, and it'll all drop in a neat pile!

*Mod name: Chorus Fruit Drops Nearby*

![Chorus fruit drops nearby](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/chorus-fruit-drops-nearby/a.gif)

*Mod name: Scaffolding Drops Nearby*

![Scaffolding drops nearby](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/scaffolding-drops-nearby/a.gif)

### Convenient Mob Griefing

Disables creeper explosions, ghast explosions and enderman block placement.

Does not disable Wither or Ender Dragon griefing.

### Dragon Drops Elytra

Killing the Ender Dragon will drop an Elytra!

If two players both get the final blow on the Ender Dragon, the dragon will drop two Elytra.

### Easy Elytra Takeoff

Simply use a firework with Elytra equipped to take off immediately. No need to jump!

### Fire Spread Tweaks

Prevents fire from burning down blocks, or spreading to other blocks.

### Keep My Soil Tilled

Re-tills land where a pumpkin or melon grew over.

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/keep-my-soil-tilled/a.gif)

### KleeSlabs

If you break the bottom slab in a stack, only the bottom slab will break, and vice versa for the top slab.

![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/63/864/kleeslabs194.gif)

### Nether Portal Fix

Keeps track of Nether portal positions, and keeps them properly linked to their corresponding overworld portal.

### No Animal Tempt Delay

When tempting an animal with a crop, switching off your crop will normally cause a short delay before they are tempted once more. This mod eliminates that delay altogether.

### No Feather Trample

When you have Feather Falling on your boots or the Slow Falling buff active, crops will not be trampled.

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/no-feather-trample/a.gif)

### Respawning Shulkers

Respawns shulker boxes in End Cities after a few minutes for easy shulker box farming (or harder end city exploration, depending on how you look at it).

### Shulker Drops Two

Shulker Boxes will always drop two shulker shells.

### Stack Refill

Automatically refills hotbar tools, blocks, and potions when depleted.

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/stack-refill/a.gif)

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/stack-refill/c.gif)

### Sticky Enchanting Lapis

Keeps lapis in the enchanting table as a storage slot.

![](https://github.com/Serilum/.cdn/raw/main/projects/sticky-enchanting-lapis/a.gif)

### Universal Graves

When you die, a grave will be created with your stuff inside, instead of scattering items around.

You can check all your existing graves and their positions/contents with the `/graves` command. You can also destroy graves you don't wish to return to, scattering their items and removing the grave spot.

### Zombie Proof Doors

Prevents zombies from breaking down doors!





## Biomes & Terrain

### Clifftree

Adds a few nice touches to existing vanilla biomes.

[Clifftree - Gallery](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/clifftree-mod/gallery)

![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/685/145/vanilla_comparison.jpg)

### Terralith

Adds nearly one-hundred new biomes on top of vanilla Minecraft. Some add large structures, and others add more variety.

If you find Nether blocks that are naturally generated in the overworld's terrain (such as basalt), this mod is likely to be the reason why.

[Birdflop's RGB Nickname Creator](https://www.birdflop.com/resources/rgb/) can create gorgeous gradients of any color - or, if you'd like to use only basic Minecraft colors, check out [MC Utils - Color Text Generator](https://mcutils.com/color-text-generator).
