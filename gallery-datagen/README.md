# Gallery Datagen

Python code to pull a list of my projects from Hopscotch's servers in `project_list.txt`, then pull some project info from the project files and download thumbnails.

It's meant to be edited and ran manually, with functions provided as-needed.

The program will spit out a set of Vento templates,
to be rearranged and copied to `/src/gallery/index.vto`.

Thumbnails go to `/src/img/gallery`.
