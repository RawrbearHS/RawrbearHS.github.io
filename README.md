# RawrbearHS.github.io

My Hopscotch website!

## Contents

- `/src` leads to the website's code, which gets generated and minified by
the [Lume static site generator](https://lume.land/) into the actual website.
This gets generated by [Deno](https://deno.com/), which looks at
`deno.json`, `deno.lock` and `_config.ts`.

- `/gallery-datagen` contains (somewhat janky) Python code for
pulling a list of Hopscotch projects and generating a Vento template from them,
as well as a thumbnail cache.

- `/.github/workflows/publish.yml` is a GitHub Actions workflow file,
which checks for new changes to the source code,
then pulls it and builds it for the web, publishing it on GitHub Pages.


## Install and Run Locally
1. Install [Deno](https://deno.com/).
2. Open a terminal and clone this repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
(Alternatively, click on the green `<> Code` button, click `Download ZIP`, and extract it somewhere.)
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/RawrbearHS/RawrbearHS.github.io.git
  ```
3. In the terminal, navigate to the project folder with `cd`.
4. Run `deno task serve`. This downloads dependencies for Lume and some other libraries,
then runs a web server on your computer to host the website on your network.
