# RawrbearHS.github.io

My Hopscotch website!

## Contents

- `/src` leads to the website's code, which gets generated and minified by
the [Lume static site generator](https://lume.land/) into the actual website.
This gets generated by [Deno](https://deno.com/), which looks at
`deno.json`, `deno.lock` and `_config.ts`.

- `/gallery-datagen` contains (somewhat janky) Python code for
pulling a list of Hopscotch projects and generating a Vento template from them,
as well as a thumbnail cache.
